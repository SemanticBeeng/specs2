Maintenance version (3.9.3 was incorrect)

## Improvements

 * **core** when checking for the equality of 2 sets of lines only run the edit distance difference on them if they are different.
 this improves build times

## Fixes

 * **core** set the minimum number of execution threads to 4 to avoid possible deadlocks on single core machines (cf some CI environments)
 * **core** use the "user" execution environment to execute examples instead of specs2 own execution environment
