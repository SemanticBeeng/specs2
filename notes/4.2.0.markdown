Upgrade version

## Upgrades

 * **scalacheck** upgraded to ScalaCheck `1.14.0`. It is now possible to visualize the seed used
  to generate a counter-example and reuse it to run a property (`myProp.setSeed("xxx")` or use `scalacheck.seed xxx` on the command line)
  
## Improvements

 * Use `foldLeft` instead of `/:` (#654) (thanks to @xuwei-k)  
 
## Fixes

 * **junit** fixed an issue where `List(1,2) must contain(===(2))` would fail with `JUnitMatchers` and a JUnit test class
