Upgrade version

## Upgrades

 * **mockito** upgraded to Mockito `2.18.2`, this is mostly to avoid a concurrency bug introduced by Mockito (#641).
 * **html** the default options for pandoc are now compatible with pandoc `2.1.3` for markdown generation
 
 Otherwise please refer to the `4.0.4` notes for the latest changes.
